We're a regional healthcare provider focused on preventive care. But many chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease still go undetected until they become serious.â€¨
  We have access to patient records and checkup history. Could you build a model that helps us flag at-risk patients early  so we can step in with lifestyle or treatment guidance?
